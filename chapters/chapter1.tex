\section{Motivation}


\section{IRIS-Lab Context}

The \ac{ua}'s \ac{iris} conducts research projects using autonomous mobile robots, which communicate through a Wi-Fi network. Currently, this network is confined to the premises of the \ac{iris}, preventing the robots from operating in the remaining \ac{ua}'s buildings. Although the \ac{ua}'s Wi-Fi infrastructure covers most of its edifices, which can be used by the robots, due to security mechanisms, this network proves to be highly restraining, not allowing \ac{p2p} communications through the \ac{ros} - the operating system the robots run on - middleware without additional network equipaments. Moreover, these constraints keeps developers from being able to interact with the robots through their personal machines, which, if otherwise possible, would be of great interest.
