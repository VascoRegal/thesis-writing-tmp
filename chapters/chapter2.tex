\label{chapter:sota}

\begin{sota}
This chapter covers the analysis and discussion not only of the motives and advantages behind the chosen tools and protocols to be used in this project but also but also of the common approaches and methodologies conducted in research in similar scenarios.

At its core, the system requires three main dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{A protocol for encrypted, reliable and efficient \ac{p2p} communication}
    \item{A control platform for management of clients and authentication tokens}
    \item{A mechanism for scalibility, able to transform the many \ac{p2p} channels into one mesh network}
\end{itemize}
\end{sota}
